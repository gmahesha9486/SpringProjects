Main class should have the annotation @SpringBootApplication

@SpringBootApplication
public class CourseApiApp { 
	............
}

--------
start the main application. create a servlet container and host the application in that container.
SpringApplication.run(CourseApiApp.class, args);

-----------

what this line does ?
SpringApplication.run(CourseApiApp.class, args);

Sets up default configuration  
starts spring application context : It's a container for all your code that runs on application server.
performs class path scan : looking for stereotype annotations etc...
starts tomcat server

=====================

If you want any class to make rest controller, use annotation
@RestController

In this class you can have methods which maps to url request.

@RequestMapping("/hello")
		public String sayhi() { }

Note: By default the @RequestMapping annotation maps to all http methods.
